    <h1>Odin's Chicken Salad</h1>
    <img src="../images/chicken-salad.webp" alt="image of a chicken salad">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In Canada and the United States, "chicken salad" refers to either any salad with chicken, or a specific mixed salad consisting primarily of chopped chicken meat and a binder, such as mayonnaise, salad dressing or cream cheese.</p>

    <p>Though it appeared a couple years earlier in a German cookbook, for a “Mayonnaise de poulet” which is FRENCH for “Chicken in Mayonnaise”) So Chicken's already being tossed in Mayonnaise, AND being made into Salad at the same time. The typical European way of "sorting things out" back then, as well!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 each skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 (26.5 ounce) cans spaghetti sauce, divided</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        <li>Step 2</li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat and add chicken breasts; reduce heat and let simmer until chicken falls apart easily with a fork and is no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain water, shred chicken with 2 forks, and set aside.
        <li>Step 3</li>
        While chicken is boiling, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and lay noodles in a single, flat layer on a paper towel to dry.
        <li>Step 4</li>
        Heat butter in a small saute pan over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in the hot butter just until onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.
        <li>Step 5</li>
        Mix shredded chicken, onion-garlic mixture, 1 cup spaghetti sauce, ricotta cheese, 1/2 of the Parmesan cheese, and Italian seasoning together in a large bowl.
        <li>Step 7</li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese bubbles, about 45 minutes.
    </ol>
