    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In Canada and the United States, "chicken salad" refers to either any salad with chicken, or a specific mixed salad consisting primarily of chopped chicken meat and a binder, such as mayonnaise, salad dressing or cream cheese.</p>

    <p>Though it appeared a couple years earlier in a German cookbook, for a “Mayonnaise de poulet” which is FRENCH for “Chicken in Mayonnaise”) So Chicken's already being tossed in Mayonnaise, AND being made into Salad at the same time. The typical European way of "sorting things out" back then, as well!</p>
