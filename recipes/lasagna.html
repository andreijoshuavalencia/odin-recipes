    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna nood</p>

    <p>It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that varies based on different local traditions.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 each skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 (26.5 ounce) cans spaghetti sauce, divided</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        <li>Step 2</li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat and add chicken breasts; reduce heat and let simmer until chicken falls apart easily with a fork and is no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain water, shred chicken with 2 forks, and set aside.
        <li>Step 3</li>
        While chicken is boiling, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and lay noodles in a single, flat layer on a paper towel to dry.
        <li>Step 4</li>
        Heat butter in a small saute pan over medium-high heat. Saute onion and garlic in the hot butter just until onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes.
        <li>Step 5</li>
        Mix shredded chicken, onion-garlic mixture, 1 cup spaghetti sauce, ricotta cheese, 1/2 of the Parmesan cheese, and Italian seasoning together in a large bowl.
        <li>Step 7</li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheese bubbles, about 45 minutes.
    </ol>
